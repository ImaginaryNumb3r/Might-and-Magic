# Might-and-Magic

This repository is used for modding the game "Might and Magic 7" (and is also compatible with Might and Magic 8).
You have understand this repository mostly as a script which reads the key information on each monster in the game an scales it with a defined formula. 
This was helpful in creating mods that make the game more challenging and saving a copy of my mod online.
